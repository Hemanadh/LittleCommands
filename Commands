Removing Ads Temporarily in a webpage until refresh :
-------------------------
Paste it in the console
1. allow pasting (type manually in console as chrome will keep throwing warning, then you can paste below command)
  // To remove all elements with the class 'ad' or similar classes
2. document.querySelectorAll('.ad, .ads, .banner, .sponsor, .advertisement').forEach(el => el.remove());
3. if above is not working, use inspect element to find the ad element and use that in below command.  "data-freestar-ad" is add element.
  document.querySelectorAll('[data-freestar-ad]').forEach(el => el.remove());
